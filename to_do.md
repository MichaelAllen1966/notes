* Content for qual work
* Build glossary for SHAP and SAMueL-2 books

## Projects

* SAMueL
* Optimist
* Maternity + neonatal
* Mobile stroke units
* Whole stroke system (pick up in Autumn?)
* Cat

## SAMueL general work areas

* Data request
* SHAP
* Predict controversial patients with XG Boost
* New model types:
    * Embedding neural networks
* Stroke outcome model
* Demographic summary (and maps for stroke units)
* Synthetic data
* Include ambo times in pathway model
* Effect of organisational factors
* Vignettes
* Streamlit web app

## Development

* Statistical risk models
* Time series neural nets
* Transformer neural nets

## Papers:

* XG Boost and Shap to model clinical decision-making (including differences).
* Stroke outcome modelling:
    * Basic paper
    * Example of achieving target IVT and MT use and speed in England
* Neural network embedding to model components of thrombolysis
* Influence of organisational factors in thrombolysis
